title: "Fairness-aware Reweighting in Federated Learning"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: "We address the problem of enforcing group fairness in federated learning. To this end, we first adapt FairGrad, a recently proposed fairness method in centralized learning, to the federated setting. This comes with a large communication cost as it requires sharing the fairness level of the learned models after each gradient descent step. Unfortunately, using the usual federated learning trick consisting in taking several local steps before communicating with the server leads to models with low utility. To tackle this issue, we propose an alternative approach that combines ideas from FairGrad and cost-sensitive fairness methods. Our preliminary experiments show that this new method is either competitive or better than several state-of-the-art approaches."
