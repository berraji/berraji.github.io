title: "FLECS-CGD: A Federated Learning Second-Order Framework via Compression and Sketching with Compressed Gradient Differences"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: "In the recent paper FLECS (Agafonov et al, FLECS: A Federated Learning Second-Order Frame-work via Compression and Sketching), the second-order framework FLECS was proposed for theFederated Learning problem. This method utilize compression of sketched Hessians to make communication costs low. However, the main bottleneck of FLECS is gradient communication without compression. In this paper, we propose the modification of FLECS with compressed gradient differences, which we call FLECS-CGD (FLECS with Compressed Gradient Differences) and make it applicable for stochastic optimization. Convergence guarantees are provided in strongly convex and nonconvex cases. Experiments show the practical benefit of proposed approach."
